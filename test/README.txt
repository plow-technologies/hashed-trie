These are the tests for the list-tries library by Matti Niemenmaa, and should
reside in a subdirectory of the list-tries distribution.

To run the tests, run 'Main.hs', or build list-tries with the "testing" flag.

Unlike the library itself, no attempt has been made to make sure that the tests
would work with anything other than GHC.
